##Game theory in ecology and evolution - [ECMTB 2014][ecmtb]

Theoretical developments in evolution and ecology have undergone a sea change since the inception of evolutionary game theory in the early seventies. In combination with population genetics, this has enabled theoretical aspects of biological systems to be understood at the genotypic as well as the phenotypic level. This understanding has pervaded a plethora of fields from language evolution to cancer dynamics. This minisymposium focuses on recent mathematical and theoretical developments in evolutionary game theory in ecology and evolution.

Based on the interest in the double minisymposium held at the last ECMTB we plan to run two sessions on “Game theory in ecology and evolution” for [ECMTB 2014][ecmtb] with eight speakers to take place during the conference i.e. between the 15th and the 19th of June 2014.
