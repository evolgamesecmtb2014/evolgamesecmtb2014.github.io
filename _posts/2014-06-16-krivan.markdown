Professor of applied mathematics

My research focuses on applications of mathematics to biology and ecology.  In particular, I'm interested in links between animal behavior, population dynamics and evolutionary processes that preserve biodiversity on Earth. I study these links by creating mathematical models that allow me to discover new laws of biodiversity. To this end, I combine game theoretical methods with differential equations. These methodologies include theory of evolutionarily stable strategies,  theory of differential equations with discontinuous vector fields, control theory and differential inclusions.
