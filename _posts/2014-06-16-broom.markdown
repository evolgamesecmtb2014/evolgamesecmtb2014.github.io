Mark's research interests are in Mathematical Biology, in particular Evolutionary Game Theory. This includes both theoretical work on general games and the modelling of specific animal behaviours. Main research areas include multiplayer game theory, models of food stealing (kleptoparasitism), the signalling behaviour of prey species, and evolutionary processes on graphs.
