##Time delays in stochastic models of evolutionary games


###Abstract 
It is usually assumed that interactions between individuals take place instantaneously and their effects are immediate. In reality, all social and biological processes take certain amount of time. It is natural therefore to introduce time delays into evolutionary game models.
We will discuss combined effects of stochasticity and time delays in various finite-population, discrete-time evolutionary games. A state of a population of individuals is stochastically stable if it appears with a high frequency inthe limit of small stochastic perturbations of deterministic dynamics. We show the existence of a stochastically stable cycle in two-player games with a mixed evolutionarily stable strategy for any discrete time delay.The situation is much more complex in there-player games with two evolutionarily stable strategies, a mixed and a pure one. In particular, we show that if the basin of attraction of the mixed equilibrium is bigger than the one of the pure equilibrium, then there exists a critical time delay where the pure equilibrium becomes stochastically stable.Bibliography
